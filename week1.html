            <h2>Week 1 - February 13, 2025</h2>
            <p>The construction of the new studio apartment complex, set to open in fall 2025, began on a chilly February morning. The site, just a block from the university campus, was already buzzing with activity as crews arrived at dawn. A temporary chain-link fence enclosed the perimeter, and a large blue sign at the street corner announced: "UNIVERSITY GROUP — LEASING FALL 2025 — 217-352-3182 — www.ugroupcu.com." The sign, weathered slightly by the winter air, caught the attention of students hurrying to class, many of whom paused to glance at the future home they might soon call their own.</p>
            
            <p>By mid-morning, the site was alive with the sounds of heavy machinery. Excavators dug into the frost-hardened ground, their buckets scraping away layers of soil to prepare for the foundation. Surveyors marked the corners of the building with wooden stakes and bright pink string, their breath visible in the cold air as they double-checked measurements. Nearby, a group of workers unloaded materials from a truck, their movements brisk to ward off the winter chill. I struck up a conversation with one of them, a seasoned construction worker who had traveled from a nearby town for the project. "This is gonna be a good one," he said, nodding toward the site. "Lots of students need a place like this."</p>
            
            <p>As the day progressed, the crew began pouring the foundation. Steam rose from the wet concrete as workers smoothed it into place, their trowels moving quickly to combat the freezing temperatures. The rhythmic hum of activity was punctuated by the occasional shout of instructions or the rumble of a truck engine. Despite the cold, the team worked efficiently, their progress visible in the growing outline of the building's base.</p>
            
            <p>To ensure the project stayed on track, the site foreman periodically assessed productivity. He used a simple but effective method: observing the crew in short, random intervals to gauge how many workers were actively engaged in tasks. For example, during one observation, he noted that out of 15 workers, 10 were actively working, while the others were taking a brief Academics taking a brief break or preparing materials. This quick snapshot helped him identify whether the crew was maintaining a steady pace without disrupting their workflow. He also categorized workers into those directly performing tasks, those assisting, and those who were momentarily idle. This approach allowed him to adjust assignments and ensure everyone was contributing effectively.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The foreman explained that these assessments were crucial for keeping the project on schedule. "You can't just assume everyone's working at full speed all the time," he said. "But if you check in randomly and keep an eye on the overall flow, you can spot any bottlenecks before they become a problem." He also emphasized the importance of not overreacting to small delays or breaks, as they were a natural part of the workday.</p>
