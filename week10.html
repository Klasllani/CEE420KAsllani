            <h2>Week 10 - April 17, 2025</h2>
            <p>Week 10 at 60 E. Green St. brought a subtle shift to the studio apartment site, where the steel framework above the first floor’s roof stood firm, now draped with temporary tarps and enclosures. Workers bustled across scaffolding, securing weatherproofing to shield welds from spring rain, a small but critical step to protect the structure. The rustle of tarps and hum of drills filled the air, a quiet prelude to bigger tasks. This logistical pivot leaned on sharp decision-making, echoing computational methods we’d studied, ensuring the project stayed on course for Fall 2025.</p>
            
            <p>Installing weatherproofing demanded precise coordination—too many tarps wasted money, too few risked damage. The site manager used a linear programming approach to optimize resources, balancing tarp quantities and labor hours. With three suppliers offering different prices ($10, $12, $15 per tarp) and delivery times, the goal was to minimize costs while covering 500 square meters. Constraints included a $2,000 budget and a two-day deadline. By mapping costs and delivery schedules, the manager assigned the cheapest supplier for 300 meters, the mid-tier for 150, and the priciest for 50, hitting the target at $1,950. This data-driven choice avoided delays, unlike a prior week’s supply snag, and kept welds dry.</p>
            
            <p>The decision wasn’t just numbers; it shaped the crew’s rhythm. Workers, still stinging from Week 9’s stress, appreciated clear directives from a pre-shift meeting. The foreman’s agenda outlined tarp placement, minimizing confusion. One worker, rushing to secure a tarp, nearly slipped on scaffolding—a human error caught by a colleague’s shout, underscoring the need for focus. The meeting, concise with action items, reinforced safety checks, ensuring tarps were taut and scaffolds stable. This small task, though not structural, was critical: wet welds could weaken the frame, a latent failure waiting to emerge.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">As tarps snapped in the breeze, I saw decisions weaving the site together. The manager’s calculations, paired with clear communication, turned a mundane task into a shield for progress. By week’s end, the framework stood guarded, unchanged but ready for what’s next. The project’s pulse held steady, driven by choices that balanced cost, time, and people, keeping the Fall 2025 goal in sight.</p>
