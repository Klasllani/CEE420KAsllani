            <h2>Week 5 - March 13, 2025</h2>
            <p>By Week 5, the studio apartment site at 60 E. Green St. resembled a giant steel Rubik’s cube, its grid of beams forming the backbone of the future building. Workers maneuvered vehicles—trucks and lifts—through the maze, delivering steel components to precise locations. The air buzzed with the clank of metal and the roar of engines as crews bolted beams together, their movements a choreography of effort against the chilly March wind. This intricate dance of construction highlighted the human element, where physical and environmental factors directly shaped productivity, a key focus from our recent studies.</p>
            
            <p>The physical demands on workers were evident as they hauled heavy steel and operated machinery. Energy expenditure was high—lifting beams and climbing the grid taxed their skeletal muscles, drawing from a finite energy reservoir. Short-term fatigue set in quickly; I noticed a welder pause after an hour, his breathing heavy, signaling a need for rest to avoid overexertion. The foreman had mixed heavy tasks with lighter ones, like vehicle coordination, to manage this fatigue. Pulse rates likely spiked during intense lifts, and without breaks, recovery would lag, cutting efficiency. Matching workers’ capabilities to these tasks was crucial—seasoned crew handled the grid’s upper tiers while newer hands stayed ground-level.</p>
            
            <p>Environmental conditions added another layer. The cold wind whipped through the open steel structure, chilling hands and slowing movements. Workers donned thick gloves and jackets, but the bite of the weather still dulled their pace. Temporary enclosures around key welding zones offered some relief, trapping radiant heat to keep fingers nimble. Noise from vehicles and tools was constant, a steady drone that could fray focus over hours. The crew adapted with ear protection, but the foreman kept shifts balanced to prevent mental fatigue from the relentless clamor. Humidity was low, sparing them heat stress, but hydration stations dotted the site to maintain energy levels.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">These factors—physical strain, cold, and noise—could’ve derailed progress, but proactive management kept the steel grid rising. Rest cycles let workers recharge, avoiding the productivity drop of long-term fatigue. As vehicles rolled in with the next load, I saw how understanding human limits wasn’t just theory—it was the difference between a stalled site and one on track for Fall 2025. The Rubik’s cube of steel grew taller, a testament to workers thriving despite the challenges.</p>
