            <h2>Week 6 - March 20, 2025</h2>
            <p>The sixth week brought with it the first floor’s roof. Now fully set, it capped the steel skeleton below. Workers swarmed over scaffolding, welding final joints and laying decking, while fresh "hard hat area" signs gleamed on the perimeter fence, a stark warning of the site’s dangers. The absence of cranes shifted reliance to manual labor and smaller lifts, intensifying the bustle. This evolving landscape, vibrant yet perilous, made safety the week’s focus, echoing lessons on construction hazards and their management.</p>
            
            <p>The site’s dynamic nature bred constant risks. Scaffolding, adjusted daily to reach the new roof, posed fall hazards, while welders and riggers worked shoulder-to-shoulder, their tasks—sparks flying, heavy decking hauled—creating overlapping dangers. An incident, any event with harm potential, loomed in small missteps: a loose plank or a dropped tool could escalate to injury. The foreman countered with daily toolbox talks, drilling new workers on protocols. He shared a recent near-miss—a deck panel nearly slipped during placement—clarifying the hazard (unsecured material) versus the risk (its chance of causing harm). Those "hard hat area" signs weren’t just decor; they signaled vigilance to keep passersby and crews safe.</p>
            
            <p>Safety practices were non-negotiable, rooted in standards to protect lives and livelihoods. Harnesses anchored workers on the roof’s edge, checked each shift to prevent falls, a top killer in construction. Barricades beneath scaffolding caught potential debris, safeguarding ground crews. These measures saved more than lives—they curbed costs. A single injury could balloon workers’ compensation, with medical bills dwarfed by indirect hits like retraining or delays. The company’s Experience Modification Rate, a safety scorecard, sat at a strong 0.85, boosting their bids for future jobs. Safety also built trust; a clean record drew skilled workers and client confidence, vital for the Fall 2025 deadline.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Watching a roofer clip his harness before stepping onto the deck, I saw safety as the project’s pulse. The first floor’s roof stood firm, a testament to care over haste. No cranes meant more hands-on work, but the crew’s discipline—bolstered by those fence signs—kept hazards at bay. By week’s end, the site felt solid, not just in steel but in the commitment to send everyone home whole.</p>
