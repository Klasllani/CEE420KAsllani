            <h2>Week 7 - March 27, 2025</h2>
            <p>The studio apartment site at 60 E. Green St. pulsed with activity in Week 7, the air thick with the sharp scent of molten metal. Welders were everywhere, their torches flashing across the steel framework, fusing beams above the first floor’s new roof. Sparks rained down, and the steady hiss of their work filled my ears, a reminder of the skill and danger intertwined here. With construction pushing upward, safety remained the backbone, its importance clearer than ever amid the flurry of welding.</p>
            
            <p>The site’s hazards shifted daily—scaffolding climbed higher, and welders juggled heavy tools in tight spaces. Some grumbled about time pressures, feeling stretched thin, while others shrugged off risks, calling it just part of the job. These attitudes worried the foreman, who saw danger in such acceptance. A new welder, fresh to the crew, nearly tripped on loose decking, a small incident that could’ve been worse. It highlighted a lack of training for some, a gap that could turn hazards into injuries. The team needed more than hard hats; they needed knowledge to spot trouble before it struck.</p>
            
            <p>Training was the answer, rolled out with urgency. Morning sessions covered welding risks—burns, fumes, falls—teaching workers to check their gear and secure platforms. The foreman, a competent person by site standards, led toolbox talks, urging vigilance. He wasn’t just barking orders; he had authority to halt unsafe work, like when he stopped a welder using a frayed harness. These efforts tied to a bigger safety system: regular inspections scoured the site for loose bolts or cluttered walkways, catching issues early. The company’s low accident rate kept insurance costs down, a financial win that let them invest in better gear, like flame-resistant gloves for every welder.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">As I watched welders arc their torches, I saw safety as a quiet force holding the chaos together. No one wanted an investigation—those costly probes into accidents that stop work cold. The site hummed because training and checks kept risks at bay, not luck. By week’s end, more beams were locked in, the project on pace for Fall 2025. The welders’ sparks lit the way, but it was their care, guided by a firm safety net, that kept the site steady.</p>
