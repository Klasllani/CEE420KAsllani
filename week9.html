            <h2>Week 9 - April 10, 2025</h2>
            <p>In the ninth week, welders still sparking along the steel framework above the first floor’s roof, unchanged from recent weeks. At midday, workers sprawled across the site for lunch, some perched on beams, others near a white Ram truck where a mechanic tinkered under the hood, tools clinking. The break was a brief pause in the grind, but it revealed the human factors—stress, errors, communication—that shape this project, mirroring challenges we’d studied.</p>
            
            <p>Lunchtime chatter carried hints of stress from long hours and the relentless pace. Welders swapped gripes about sore backs, a nod to poor ergonomics in wielding heavy torches. One worker, distracted during a morning task, had misaligned a weld—a slip, not a mistake, caught before it set. The incident stemmed from a lapse in focus, likely from fatigue, worsened by unclear instructions from a rushed foreman. Communication faltered elsewhere too: the mechanic under the truck cursed a vague repair order, unsure which part to fix. These small human failures, if ignored, could snowball, turning minor errors into hazards on a site already taut with pressure.</p>
            
            <p>The foreman stepped in, holding a toolbox talk post-lunch to reset the crew. He stressed clear communication, urging workers to double-check tasks and report issues, not assume. A new rule banned eating on beams, citing safety after a dropped sandwich nearly hit someone below—an active failure avoided. Ergonomics got attention too: welders were given lighter torches to ease strain, a small tweak to boost comfort and focus. These fixes weren’t just about productivity; they were about people, the root of most site problems. A quick meeting, concise with a written agenda, ensured everyone heard the same message, cutting through the noise of a busy site.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">As the mechanic slammed the truck’s hood shut, the crew returned to their welds, steadier now. The lunch break, though brief, exposed the human side of construction—where stress and missteps lurk but can be managed. By week’s end, the framework held firm, its seams flawless, the project still on track for Fall 2025. Small adjustments, born from understanding people’s limits, kept the site humming, proving that even a sandwich or a truck repair can teach a lesson.</p>
